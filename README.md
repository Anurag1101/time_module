**Time-based Greeting Program**

Welcome to the **Time-based Greeting Program!** This Python script generates a customized greeting depending on the current time of day, providing a user-friendly interaction that adjusts dynamically based on the hour.

**Overview**:

This project was designed to create a simple yet functional program that greets users based on the time they run the script. The program utilizes the time module from Python's standard library to fetch and display the current system time. Then, it returns an appropriate greeting based on predefined time intervals, such as "Good Morning" or "Good Night."

This type of program can be helpful for adding a time-aware greeting system to larger projects, enhancing user interaction, or even as an introduction to learning how Python handles date and time operations.

**Key Features**:

**Current Time Display:** The program prints the current system time in HH:MM:SS format before providing a greeting.

**Dynamic Greeting:** The greeting changes based on the hour of the day:

    Good Morning: From 12:00 AM to 11:59 AM.
    
    Good Afternoon: From 12:00 PM to 2:59 PM.
    
    Good Evening: From 3:00 PM to 7:59 PM.
    
    Good Night: From 8:00 PM onward.
    
**Simple and Lightweight:** Requires no external dependencies, only standard Python libraries.

**How It Works**:

**Time Retrieval:**  The script uses the time.strftime() function to obtain the current system time.

**Hour Extraction:** The hour component of the time is extracted and used to determine the greeting category.

**Greeting Display:** A greeting is printed based on the time, creating a dynamic experience for the user.

**Use Cases**:

**Daily Interaction:** Integrate this script into systems or applications that interact with users daily, such as a desktop assistant or automated notification systems.

**Learning Project:** Ideal for beginners who are learning how to handle time functions in Python.

**UI/UX Enhancement:** Can be used to enhance the user experience in simple applications, making them feel more interactive and time-sensitive.
